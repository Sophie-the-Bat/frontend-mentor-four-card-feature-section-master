## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

placing of cards took some thought

colored stripe on each card was very tricky to follow the border-radius,
should have tried a background gradient maybe? 

### Continued development

- use a background gradient for the colored stripe
- rebuild with grid
